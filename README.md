## Looking to a convention

A directory of performing artists was created using whatever I had
available to me, at any free tier or at lowest cost. Most of these
require familiarity with the internals of servers to get them to work. I
looked online for places where the bulk of the code was already in
place. I used it as for what I needed by changing just enough of the
template. I will be focusing on the situations where it is good practice
to keep notes about how you are altering the templates.

**Separate focus from a UX designer role**

I will need to step lightly with separating myself from coding to work
within the aims of the people and stakeholders involved. I will be
reviewing my notes-to-self every time I take, ideally, a critical turn
in the work of any in-progress work. Because this project revolved
around a technical activation of a website using a modern app-marketed
tool, there will be some overlap of roles.

**Revamped priorities**

Eventually, this project produced a profile list. Taking on conflicting
roles meant that finishing the displayable list had snubbed any thought
to consider the search listings that illustrated a milestone to be
accomplished. This was not addressed in any particular way.

**Getting it right the first time**

There is a fine line between how it looks, and how it works. It easy to
thing you are aligned on the problem.

**Easy to follow**

It is important to not drum up a list of todos immediately. Some
resources of the website would call out to existing site and documents
in published by the stakeholder. Those unpublished were put in place
with the help of an Airtable service. This is were our data would live.

### Project Challenge

The current state of the site has a lot of background information for
each performer. The control to update details was handled by the
stakeholder.

### Discovery

So many lessons learned on this project that span coding in Vue.js,
deployment, and information architecture.

**User Testing**

Using Mixpanel to track first-clicks and beyond, I tested the profile
page to give the profile a home. The profile page was tested remotely on
the video app of choice by the interviewee.

**Competitive**

Northlight, Ticketmaster, 4-Star, and NBC were all analyzed as to
achieve a layout that works on

1.  photo size and placement
2.  what items are included as part of the contact details
3.  placement of copyright notice

Through a use of spreadsheets, we made a tally of what was needed by
other websites to get a sense of what is standard across the established
actor-directory websites.

**Comparative**

I made a chart of industry terms to increase the efficiency of booking
agents at finding talent. Included Backstage, Second City, Actors Access
on what were the most used words by:

1.  Count
2.  Used in navigation
3.  Used as categories in blog sections

We focused on this to make decisions about our URL structure. The
importance of the URL is an SEO mainstay. Given its importance, I set
out to use Vue adjacent tools.

### Design

**Sketches**

We started looking at the original. A long list that did not paginate.
This can be inefficient to scroll all the way to the end, resulting in
overlooking some key performers. Using
[Marvelapp](<https://marvelapp.com/>) and 3x5 cards, I sketched out about
three final variations on a complete cast landing page in order to
choose a more compact collection layout. Over 20 performers are now
shown within a square collection format.

**Wireframes**

Given an unknown set of actor records, I wireframed at least two views,
starting with mobile, in order to look at picture placement and text
sizes . Justinmind prototyping software immediately helped load a data
collection into the first wireframes. It is important to not assume to
much. When using a persona representation, I try to 'live it' throughout
the user flow and wireframing. If our persona, "Dori" is pulling out her
phone as she's walking her dog, it is only one instance. But finding
loopholes is about at least living through "loop one."

**Guidelines**

I didn't want the user necessate learning and re-learning placement. At
design merge, I kept the colors and font and focused on the root landing
page. The initial components where Material-based components. I would
use this to maintain alignment and uniformity. If we lived through a
user flow, we could make those decisions live in a style guide.

### Project Summary

-   The performer name placement is an important convention that reflects
    the real-world headshots that are handed in at auditions.
-   Templates least serve the user on exposure goals
-   I enjoyed reading the many varied bios of performers
-   I got to delve in deep and live out the process of getting a headshot
    taken
-   Having the hometown date as a connector category for the user or the
    booking agent may be a significant next step.
