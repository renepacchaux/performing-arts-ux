# Performing as one

**Intro** A directory of performing artists was created using a frontend
tool written in code. I used it as a framework for what I needed. I will
be focusing on the situations where it is good practice to implement the
code.

**Separate focus from a UX designer role** I will need to step lightly
with separating myself from coding to work within the aims of the people
and stakeholders involved. I will be reviewing my notes-to-self writing
everytime I take a snapshot of my in-progress work. Because this project
revolved around a technical activation of a website using a modern
app-marketed tool, there will be some overlap of roles.

**Revamped priorities** Eventually, this project produced a profile list.
Taking on conflicting roles meant that finishing the displayable list
had snubbed any thought to consider the search listings that illustrated
a milestone to be accomplished. This was not addressed in any particular
way.

Aesthetics was the focus, but not the problem. What would I go back and
do differently? Was it easy to follow my own flow? What if the
trajectory was smooth but the result disjointed? I have, as a result,
API implementation and a Vue front end with an airtable backend.

## Project Challenge

The current state of the site has a static entry of background
information for each performer.

## Discovery

So many lessons learned on this project that span coding in Vue.js,
deployment, and information architecture.

**User Testing**

Using Mixpanel to track first-clicks and beyond, I tested the profile
page to give the profile a home. The profile page was tested remotely on
the video app of choice by the interviewee.

**Competitive**

Northlight, Ticketmaster, 4-Star, and NBC were all analyzed as to
achieve a layout that works on

1.  photo size and placement
2.  what items are included as part of the contact details
3.  placement of copyright notice

Through dropbox paper tables, we made a tally of the critical bits
standard across the established websites.

**Comparative**

I made a chart of industry terms to increase the efficiency of booking
agents at finding talent. Included Backstage, Second City, Actors Access
on what were the most used words by:

1.  Count
2.  Used in navigation
3.  Used as categories in blog sections

We focused on this to make decisions about our URL structure. The
importance of the URL is an SEO mainstay. Given its importance, I set
out to use Vue adjacent tools.

## Design

**Sketches**

We started looking at the original. A long list that did not paginate.
This can be inefficient to scroll all the way to the end, resulting in
overlooking some key performers. Using
[Marvelapp](<https://marvelapp.com/>) and 3x5 cards, I sketched out about
3 final variations on a full cast landing page in order to choose a more
compact collection layout. Over 20 performers now are shown within a
square collection format.

**Wireframes**

I wireframes at least two views, starting with mobile, in order to look
at picture placement and text sizes given an unknown set of actor
records. Justinmind prototyping software immediately help load a data
collection into the first wireframes. It is important to not assume to
much. When using a persona representation, I try to 'live it' throught
the userflow and wireframing. If our persona, "Dori" is pulling out her
phone as she's walking her dog &#x2013; it is only one instance. But finding
loopholes is about at least living through "loop one."

**Guidelines**

I didn't want the user to have to learn and re-learn (two ways of doing
the same thing), so at design merge, I kept the colors and font and
focused on the root landing page. The initial components where
Material-based components. I would use this to maintain alignment and
uniformity. If we lived through a userflow, we can make those decisions
live in a style guide.

## Project Summary

-   The proximity of name to performer is an important convention that
    reflects the real-world headshots that are handed in at auditions.
-   Templates least serve the user on exposure goals
-   I enjoyed reading the many varied bios of performers
-   I got to delve in deep and live out the process of getting a headshot
    taken
-   Having the hometown date as a connector category for the user or
    booking agent may be a significant next step.
