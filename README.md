# Performing Arts UX

## Talent Pool

GLX is a talent pool presence that bring together talend to leveraging arguments of exposure.  It provides exposure-footing by creating a profil, bio and connection history.  I collaborated with Jesse, a graphic designer remotely, and in many conversations with the stakeholder and group director, Mishel Livio.


### Project Challenge

The current state of the site has a static entry of background information for each performer.

#### Discovery
So many lessons learned on this project that span conding in Vue.js, deployment, and information architecture.


##### User Testing
Using mixpanel to track first-clicks and beyond, I tested the profile page to give the profile a home. The profile page was tested remote computer style, on the video app of choice by the interviewee, usually at dinner time.  Among the interviewees, Holly Jessye and Karl all participated without having to share their desktop screen.

##### Competitive
Northlight, Ticketmaster, 4-Star and NBC where all analyzed as part of the competition to achieve a layout that works on 
1. photo size and placement
2. what items are included as part of the contact details
3. placement of copyright notice

Through dropbox paper tables we where able to make a tally of the important bits common across the established websites.

##### Comparative
I made a chart of industry terms to increase the efficiency of booking agents at finding talent. Included Backstage, Second City, Actors Access on what where the most used terms by:
1. Count
2. Used in navigation
3. Used as categories in blog sections

We focused on this to make decisions about our url structure. The importance of the url is an SEO mainstay.  Given it's importance, I set out to use Vue adjacent tools.


### Project solution
I coded this on Vue.js.
