## Looking to a convention

**Project Challenge**

The current state of the site has a lot of background information for
each performer. The control to update details was handled by the
stakeholder.

A directory of performing artists was created using whatever I had
available to me, at any free tier or at lowest cost. Most of these
require familiarity with the internals of servers to get them to work. I
looked online for places where the bulk of the code was already in
place. By changing just enough of the template, I used it for what was
needed. I will be focusing on situations where it is good practice to
keep notes about how you are altering the templates.

**Separate focus from a UX designer role**

I will need to step lightly with separating myself from coding to work
within the aims of the people and stakeholders involved. I will be
reviewing my notes-to-self every time I take, ideally, a critical turn
in the work of any in-progress work. Because this project revolved
around a technical activation of a website using a modern app-marketed
tool, there will be some overlap of roles.

**Revamped priorities**

Eventually, this project produced a profile list. Taking on conflicting
roles meant that finishing the displayable list had snubbed any thought
to consider the search listings that illustrated a milestone to be
accomplished. This was not addressed in any particular way.

**Getting it right the first time**

Ideally, there is a fine line between how it looks and how it works. It
is easy to think you are aligned on how to solve the problem.

**Easy to follow**

It is important to not drum up a list of todos immediately. Some
resources of the website would call out to existing site and documents
in published by the stakeholder. Those unpublished were put in place
with the help of an Airtable service. This is where our performer data
would live.

### Discovery

So many lessons learned on this project that span coding in Vue.js,
deployment, and information architecture.

**User Testing**

Using Mixpanel to track first-clicks and beyond, I tested the profile
page to give the profile a home. The profile page was tested remotely on
the video app of choice by the interviewee.

**Competitive**

Northlight, Ticketmaster, 4-Star, and NBC were all analyzed as to
achieve a layout that works on

1.  photo size and placement
2.  what items are included as part of the contact details
3.  placement of copyright notice

Through the use of spreadsheets, we made a tally of what was needed by
other websites to get a sense of what is standard across the established
actor-directory websites.

**Comparative**

I made a chart of industry terms to increase the efficiency of booking
agents at finding talent. Included Backstage, Second City, Actors Access
on what were the most used words by:

1.  Count
2.  Used in navigation
3.  Used as categories in blog sections

We focused on this to make decisions about what affects sharing within
other apps. The importance of technical aspect bubbles up here.
Affecting the nameing was merging with the what technical tools were in
use.

### Design

**Sketches**

Using [Marvelapp](<https://marvelapp.com/>) and 3x5 cards, I sketched out
the order of taps. We started looking at the original without too much
guessing. Would a set of users expect to see featured performers first,
or more performers as long as they kept scrolling? We kept a long list.
What would be the most common searches of a talent agent? Should I make
that decision myself and choose and show only the featured on the
first-seen layout? Currently, over 20 performers are now shown within a
set of cascading-style squares.

**Simple Lines**

Given an unknown set of actor records, I pixel-sketched the simple lines
and boxes that would be the start of the most consequential page on the
site. At least two views, starting with mobile, in order to look at
picture placement and text sizes. Justinmind prototyping software
immediately helped load a data collection into the first wireframes. It
is important to not assume to much. When using a persona representation,
I try to 'live it' throughout the user flow and wireframing. If our
persona, "Dori" is pulling out her phone as she's walking her dog, it is
only one instance. But finding loopholes is about at least living
through "loop one."

**Guidelines**

I didn't want the user necessate learning and re-learning placement. At
design merge, I kept the colors and font and focused on the root landing
page. The initial components where Material-based components. I would
use this to maintain alignment and uniformity. If we lived through a
user flow, we could make those decisions live in a style guide.

### Project Summary

-   The performer name placement is an important convention that reflects
    the real-world headshots that are handed in at auditions.
-   Templates least serve the user on exposure goals
-   I enjoyed reading the many varied bios of performers
-   I got to delve in deep and live out the process of getting a headshot
    taken
-   Having the hometown date as a connector category for the user or the
    booking agent may be a significant next step.
